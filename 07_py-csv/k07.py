# K07 - A Review of CSV Files

''' 
THE BIG BAD PLAN
0. Open up the CSV
1. Read the file, skipping the first line and last line
2. Put each job name as a dict key and each percentage (*10'd) as a dict value
3. We read through the dict and get the sum of all the values, which becomes the TOTAL value
4. Generate a random number in (0, TOTAL]
5. Traverse in this manner:
    a. Establish "count = 0" and "key = <whatever first job is>"
    b. Find the value of key in the dictionary, add it to count
    c. If the random number is less than/equal to count, we know that key is the correct job
    d. Else, we will move to the next one
6. WE HAVE OUR BIG BOI
